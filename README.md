# Optical-Character-Recognition-using-PaddleOCR
A small tutorial file on my journey with PaddleOCR. 

## Description
In this project, I used the PaddleOCR to do Optical Character recognition of different real life images, and some random images on internet. 
Along with this, I used the Python Imaging Library(PIL) to display the results of the OCR along with the image. 

## Image examples of OCR
